These trainings have been very effective for evangelism, discipleship and for multiplication of disciple making momentum among least-reached non or semi-literate people groups. Approximately $285,275 was used for international travel expenses for our US based trainers to travel overseas and mentor/train our indigenous partners. In addition, $229,805 was distributed in training grants provided to our international partners, enabling them to replicate the training and effectively equip and train local leaders. Total international field training expenses were $686,618. >In 2018, 27,097 workers were trained in 749 events in 26 countries. 1,184 Master and 1,912 Local Trainers were equipped to plant Oral Bible Churches.>Over 91 BFN training events were held around the globe with 2,571 participants.>Over 118 Bridges for Women training events were held around the world in 2018 with 3,555 women in attendance.

Located on a 15-acre campus it includes both the Wilzig Hospital and the Provident Bank Ambulatory Center. The medical center serves as a regional teaching hospital and provides renowned care for cardiac patients, women and infants, and those in needed of emergency services. JCMC is located in Jersey City, Hudson County, the fastest growing county in the state with a 9% growth rate between 2010 and 2018 (Census Bureau estimates). It is the fourth most populous county, and is geographically the smallest and most densely populated county in the state and the sixth most densely populated county in the United States with 13,731.4 residents per square mile of total area in 2010, and 14,973.9 per square mile in 2017. JCMC is a regional referral teaching hospital recognized by the IRS as an internal revenue code section 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt organization. Pursuant to its charitable purposes, JCMC provides medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner regardless of race, ethnicity, color, creed, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, or ability to pay. Moreover, JCMC operates consistently with the following criteria outlined in revenue ruling 69-545. 1. JCMC provides medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals regardless of ability to pay, including charity care, self-pay, Medicare, and Medicaid patients; 2. JCMC operates an active emergency room department that is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year on the hospital campus and a satellite campus in Bayonne; 3. JCMC maintains an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians; 4. Control of JCMC rests with its Board of Trustees and the Board of Trustees of RWJ Barnabas Health, Inc. Both boards are comprised of independent civic leaders and other prominent members of the community; and 5. Surplus funds are used to improve the quality of patients care, expand and renovate facilities and advance medical care, programs and activities. The operations of JCMC, as shown through the factors outlined above and other information contained herein, clearly demonstrate that the hospital provides substantial community benefit and that the use and control of JCMC is for the benefit of the public and that no part of the income or net earnings of the organization inures to the benefit of any private interest being served other than incidentally. JCMC's sole corporate member is RWJ Barnabas Health, Inc. (""RWJ BHthe ""System""). RWJ BH is also the tax-exempt New Jersey non-profit parent corporation of RWJBARNABAS HEALTH (""RWJBH""); AN integrated healthcare delivery system. The sole member of each entity is either RWJ BH or another RWJBH affiliate controlled or owned by RWJ BH. JCMC, like its corporate parent, is a not-for-profit organization. RWJBH is a tax-exempt integrated healthcare delivery system consisting of a group of affiliated healthcare organizations. RWJBH was formed with the merger of Barnabas Health Inc. (""BH""), the parent of the Barnabas Health System (""Barnabas Health""), and Robert Wood Johnson Health Care Corporation (""RWJHCC""), the parent of the former Robert Wood Johnson Health System (""RWJHS""). The definitive agreement signed on July 14, 2015, outlined the combination of these two leading health systems and created the largest and most comprehensive healthcare delivery system in the state of New Jersey and one of the largest in the nation RWJBH. The transaction (hereinafter referred to as the ""merger"") successfully completed federal and state review in March 2016, and the transaction closed operationally on April 1, 2016. The background of BH includes its formation in June 1996 when six New Jersey hospitals and their affiliates joined Saint Barnabas Medical Center and Union Hospital (), which had affiliated in 1993. The six hospitals included: Community Medical Center, Inc. and Kimball Medical Center, Inc., which had affiliated in 1993 to form the Community/Kimball Health Care System; Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Inc. and Irvington General Hospital, Inc. (""Irvington""), affiliates of each other since 1991; Monmouth Medical Center, Inc.; and Wayne General Hospital Corp. (""Wayne""). In January 1997, West Hudson Hospital Association, Inc. (""West Hudson"") joined Barnabas Health, followed by Clara Maass Medical Center in December 1997. Barnabas Health subsequently divested Wayne, closed West Hudson, Irvington, and Union and consolidated their operations into other system facilities. Most recently, Jersey City Medical Center joined Barnabas Health in 2014. The background of RWJHCC includes its formation in 1984 to promote, support and further the charitable purposes of the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and other affiliated and related non-profit health care organizations. RWJHS then expanded to include Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital at Hamilton, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Rahway, Childrens Specialized Hospital, Somerset Medical Center, and other healthcare related ventures. RWJBH is the largest multi-hospital system in New Jersey and continues to provide substantial community benefit as was previously provided by its formative health systems, BH and RWJHCC. RWJBH entities provide medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals regardless of ability to pay. Moreover, RWJBH entities provide healthcare services to patients who meet certain criteria defined by the New Jersey department of health without charge or at amounts less than established rates. RWJBH maintains records to identify and monitor the amount of charity care it provides. These records include the amount of charges foregone for services and supplies furnished under its charity care policy. RWJBH is New Jerseys second largest private employer with approximately 32,000 employees, nearly 7,300 individual physicians on the combined medical staffs (of which, in excess of 1,600 are employed), and over 1,000 residents and interns. RWJBH routinely captures national awards for outstanding quality and safety. The new combined system has annual operating revenues in excess of $5 billion and treats over three million patients each year with nearly 198,000 inpatient admissions, over two million outpatient visits (including over 742,000 emergency department visits) and nearly 24,000 newborn and neonatal admissions. RWJBHs composition includes 11 acute care hospitals, three acute care childrens hospitals, a leading pediatric rehabilitation hospital, a freestanding acute behavioral health center, ambulatory care centers, geriatric centers, the states largest behavioral health network, ambulatory surgery centers, comprehensive home care and hospice programs, fitness and wellness centers, retail pharmacy services, medical groups, diagnostic imaging centers and two accountable care organizations. RWJBH created with a strong foundation of shared cultures and core values provides opportunity to improve the health and promote wellness of communities throughout New Jersey. The systems geographic coverage spans the greater Hudson, Essex, Union, Middlesex, Mercer, Somerset, Monmouth and Ocean counties and encompasses the center of the state serving in excess of five million residents. Through sharing of resources, best practices, as well as economies gained through consolidation of support services, the combination of Barnabas Health and RWJHS promotes the highest quality healthcare delivery and greater levels of efficiency. In 2018, RWJBH announced with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, the official launch of their public-private partnership to jointly operate a world-class academic health system dedicated to life-changing research, clinical training of tomorrows workforce, and high-quality healthcare for all. This planned collaboration represents a significant step forward to improve access to care and reduce the health disparities that impact our state. The parties have a shared belief that while both organizations are strong leaders in our respective fields, together they are better poised to transform healthcare in New Jersey and drive innovations that will improve outcomes across the country. The new collaboration also will align education, research, and clinical activities, including those at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and Rutgers University behavioral health care. By working together, these two higher education and health care industry leaders will enhance research, medical and health professional education, improve access to care, and reduce health disparities in New Jersey."

Community Partnerships ====================== In 2014, JCMC joined with the Boys and Girls Club of Hudson County, in welcoming the first class of 125 freshmen to the new Great Futures High School for the Health Sciences; Jersey City's first academic institution dedicated exclusively to the health sciences. The school, which is a collaborative effort between the Boys and Girls Club of Hudson County and the Jersey City Medical Center, is a state-designated charter school providing students a foundation for post-secondary education or workforce readiness in certified health-related professions. Students will learn through integrated projects, case studies and online learning. Graduating students will be certified as emergency medical technicians or patient care technicians, and also encouraged to attend college in a health-related field. The idea for a health-oriented charter high school began to take shape about five years ago when the Boys and Girls Club of Hudson County formed an alliance with JCMC that allowed students to do internships with the hospital's staff. Those short-term educational opportunities have now been expanded into the Great Futures' curriculum. In each of the coming four years, the school will add a new class. Additional Community Building Activities undertaken by JCMC improve the medical and socioeconomic well-being of the communities in our care. This is accomplished through service on state and regional advocacy committees and boards, volunteerism with local community-based non-profit advocacy groups, and participation in conferences and other educational activities to promote understanding of the root causes of health concerns. JCMC provides educational materials, conducts community health fairs and holds health education seminars and outreach sessions for its patients and for community providers. Presentations are provided by physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals. We also provide to schools, senior centers and other community organizations programs about safety and trauma prevention including proper use of car seats, bicycle safety, and fall prevention for seniors.

THE COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES EACH OF WHO ARE INDEPENDENT AND ARE FREE FROM ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE COMMITTEE RELIED UPON APPROPRIATE COMPARABLE DATA; SPECIFICALLY THE COMMITTEE OBTAINED A WRITTEN COMPENSATION STUDY FROM AN INDEPENDENT FIRM WHICH SPECIALIZES IN THE REVIEW OF HOSPITAL AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THIS STUDY USED COMPARABLE GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC MARKET DATA INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, SIMILARLY SIZED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND HOSPITALS, # OF LICENSED BEDS AND NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. THE COMMITTEE ADEQUATELY DOCUMENTED THE BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION THROUGH THE TIMELY PREPARATION OF WRITTEN MINUTES OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MEETINGS DURING WHICH THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS WAS REVIEWED AND SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED.

THE PLAN OF WORK AND ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES, WHICH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2015, INCLUDE BRANDING THE REGION AS AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION FOR COMPANY INVESTMENT BY MARKETING AND ADVERTISING THROUGH MULTIPLE PLATFORMS. THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE PARTNERSHIP WILL UTILIZE PLATFORMS INCLUDING A WEBSITE, INDUSTRY SPECIFIC BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS REPORTS, PRINTED MATERIALS, COORDINATED VISITS TO TARGETED BUSINESS CONSULTANTS, BROKERS, AND CORPORATE SITE SELECTION PROFESSIONALS, AND COLLABORATING WITH THE MISSISSIPPI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, AND SOUTH MISSISSIPPI ELECTRIC POWER ASSOCIATION. IN ADDITION, THE PARTNERSHIP WILL MAINTAIN A DATABASE OF INDUSTRIAL REAL ESTATE IN THE AREA FOR THE PURPOSES OF RESPONDING TO SPECIFIC PROPERTY REQUESTS. THIS DATABASE WILL CONSIST OF PROPERTY SUITABLE FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT (I.E. PROPERTY CONTROLLED BY THE LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONAL WITH APPROPRIATE UTILITY ACCESS, IN PROXIMITY TO LOGISTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, ETC.) AND MAINTAINED IN SUCH A WAY TO INCLUDE GIS MAPPING, OVERHEAD PHOTOGRAPHS, UTILITY INFORMATION, AND LOGISTICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE PARTNERSHIP WILL ANALYZE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BY GEOGRAPHY AND DETERMINE THE BEST NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS TO VISIT IN ORDER TO MARKET THE REGION. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE GROUP OBSERVES A LARGE AMOUNT OF CORPORATE OR BROKER ACTIVITY ORIGINATING FROM THE DALLAS REGION, REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PARTNERSHIP WILL TRAVEL TO THAT AREA AND MEET WITH THOSE BUSINESSES OR BROKERS TO PRESENT, IN PERSON, THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SOUTHWEST MISSISSIPPI. FINALLY, THE ORGANIZATION WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THE STATE WITH SIMILAR INTEREST AS THE PARTNERSHIP. EXAMPLES INCLUDE INTEGRATING OUR MARKETING PLANS WITH THAT OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, AND SOUTH MISSISSIPPI ELECTRIC POWER ASSOCIATION. THE MEMBERS WILL CONDUCT THE ABOVE BUSINESS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE PARTNERSHIP'S WEBSITE AND DATABASE OF INDUSTRIAL REAL ESTATE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PRIORITY TO MAINTAIN. THOSE ACTIVITIES WERE COMPLETED THE LAST QUARTER OF 2015 BUT WILL REQUIRE EACH MEMBER TO MAINTAIN ACCURATE DATA THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS MEANS OF MARKETING THE REGION FOR JOB GROWTH. A SMALLER GROUP OF PARTNERSHIP OFFICERS WILL TRAVEL ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO IMPORTANT MARKETS IN ORDER TO PRESENT A BUSINESS CASE TO CORPORATE REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS AS TO THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEW CORPORATE LOCATION IN SOUTHWEST MISSISSIPPI. FINALLY, THE OFFICERS WILL, ON A ROUTINE BASIS, REMAIN IN CONTACT WITH OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THE STATE IN ORDER TO BETTER COORDINATE EFFECTIVE MARKETING STRATEGIES. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 50% OF THE MEMBER'S TIME WILL BE SPENT ON MAINTAINING AN EFFECTIVE WEBSITE AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY DATABASE. APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE MEMBERS' TIME WILL BE DEVOTED TO PLANNING AND EXECUTING MARKETING TRIPS TO APPROPRIATE NORTH AMERICAN CITIES. APPROXIMATELY 10% OF REMAINING TIME WILL BE UTILIZED BY COORDINATED WITH OTHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES (SUCH AS THE MISSISSIPPI DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY) IN ORDER TO MONITOR AND ADJUST TO THEIR CURRENT STATE MARKETING TRENDS. FINALLY, THE REMAINING 15% WILL BE UTILIZED BY ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PARTNERSHIP'S STRATEGIES AND RECOMMENDING CHANGES TO THE MEMBERSHIP."

Thus, it must attract, retain and engage the highest quality officers and key employees to lead the organization and help the organization maintain its national reputation for achieving high targets for medical quality, patient safety, and patient satisfaction. A significant portion of the organization's officers and key employees' total compensation is based on significant performance achievements. This strategy places a greater emphasis on the importance of the organization achieving targeted improvements in the areas of people, quality, patient satisfaction and financial stewardship, annually. Total executive compensation is part of an integrated talent management strategy developed by the BSW Holdings Board of Trustees and its Compensation Committee to attract, motivate, and retain the best leadership resources for the organization. Executive compensation is determined pursuant to guidelines outlined in the intermediate sanction rules under IRC Section 4958 including taking steps to meet the rebuttable presumption standard of reasonableness under Treasury Regulation 53.4958-6, as summarized below. When making compensation decisions, the organization compares itself to similarly-sized, and structured businesses including other integrated health care service systems and other similarly-sized organizations, both locally and nationally. Each year the BSW Holdings Board of Trustees and the Compensation Committee, on behalf of the organization through reserved powers held by BSW Holdings, works directly with an independent compensation expert(s) to identify reasonable and competitive market rates as well as provide an annual review of the total compensation of the organization's top management officials and other officers and key employees to ensure total compensation is within a fair market range. The annual review included management reviewing all officers and key employees listed on the Form 990 during the current tax year. Any individual whose direct compensation exceeded the projected compensation from prior year, any new individual whose position has not been reviewed by the Compensation Committee during the prior 2 years, or any individual whose responsibilities or scope of operations expanded during the current year were reviewed by the Compensation Committee during the current tax year. The Compensation Committee is made up of members of the BSW Holdings Board of Trustees, who are independent, community volunteers. Guided by the information provided by the independent compensation expert(s), the Compensation Committee approves the annual process and methodology for setting fair market salary ranges, earned incentives, and/or benefit offerings for the organization's President, other officers and/or key employees to be comparable to similar organizations for similar services and/or positions. Furthermore, the Compensation Committee is charged with the responsibility of reviewing annually the major elements of the executive compensation program to assure designs remain consistent with the business needs, market practices, and compensation philosophy. As part of the decision making process, the Compensation Committee will often meet in executive session to discuss and review recommendations made by the independent compensation expert(s). No officer or key employee whose compensation is being reviewed is present during these discussions. All decisions are properly documented in the minutes of the meetings."

THE POLICY APPLIES TO CSH BOARD OF STEWARDSHIP TRUSTEES AND MEMBERS OF ITS COMMITTEES; ALL CHI ENTITY BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE MEMBERS; ALL CSH EMPLOYEES; AND ALL CSH RESEARCH PERSONNEL (BOTH EMPLOYED AND NON-EMPLOYED). DISCLOSURE, REVIEW AND MANAGEMENT OF PERCEIVED, POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ARE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH A DEFINED COI DISCLOSURE REVIEW PROCESS. EACH PERSON MUST PROMPTLY AND FULLY DISCLOSE TO HIS/HER DIRECT MANAGER, SUPERVISOR, MEDICAL STAFF OFFICE, BOARD OR BOARD COMMITTEE CHAIR ANY SITUATION OR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MAY CREATE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE PERSON MUST DISCLOSE THE ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICT AS SOON AS SHE/HE BECOMES AWARE OF IT. IN ANY SITUATION WHERE THE PERSON MAY BE IN DOUBT, A FULL DISCLOSURE SHOULD BE MADE TO PERMIT AN IMPARTIAL AND OBJECTIVE DETERMINATION. IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL ONGOING OBLIGATION, THERE ARE INITIAL DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS. AT THE TIME OF INITIAL APPOINTMENT, A COPY OF THE POLICY SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE BOARD OR COMMITTEE MEMBER ALONG WITH A CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE. THE BOARD OR COMMITTEE MEMBER WILL COMPLETE AND SUBMIT THE DISCLOSURE. THE COMPLETED DISCLOSURE SHALL BE MAINTAINED IN CONFIDENCE AND ACCESS SHALL BE LIMITED TO PERSONS WHO HAVE A REASONABLE NEED TO KNOW THE CONTENTS. AT THE TIME OF HIRING, A COPY OF THE POLICY SHALL BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, A CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE WILL BE PROVIDED. THE EMPLOYEE MUST COMPLETE AND SUBMIT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE. THE COMPLETED DISCLOSURE SHALL BE MAINTAINED IN CONFIDENCE AND ACCESS SHALL BE LIMITED TO PERSONS WHO HAVE A REASONABLE NEED TO KNOW THE CONTENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL ONGOING AND INITIAL DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS, THERE IS AN ANNUAL DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, THE FOLLOWING PERSONS MUST COMPLETE A NEW CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE: * BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE MEMBERS; * EMPLOYEES AT THE LEVEL OF VICE PRESIDENT AND ABOVE; * RESEARCHERS; * SUPPLY CHAIN EMPLOYEES AT THE LEVEL OF VICE PRESIDENT AND ABOVE AND THOSE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN CONTRACTING REGARDLESS OF EMPLOYMENT LEVEL; * OTHER EMPLOYEES AS DEEMED APPLICABLE BY CSH LEADERSHIP; DISCLOSURES OF PERCEIVED, POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CONFLICTS INVOLVING FINANCIAL INTERESTS ARE FORWARDED TO THE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST REVIEW COMMITTEE (""C-CIRC""), NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LEGAL SERVICES, NATIONAL, ENTITY, OR RESEARCH CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM, OR THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OR BOARD CHAIR, FOR REVIEW DEPENDING ON THE POSITION OF THE PERSON INVOLVED. AMONG THE FACTORS THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER A CONFLICT EXISTS ARE THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF THE OPPORTUNITY, TRANSACTION OR ARRANGEMENT, THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT IS RELATED TO CSH'S BUSINESS, WHETHER THE PERSON WITH THE CONFLICT IS THE ULTIMATE DECISION-MAKER OR HOLDS SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE ULTIMATE DECISION-MAKER (I.E., DEGREE OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS), THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THE OPPORTUNITY, TRANSACTION OR ARRANGEMENT, THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER VIABLE ALTERNATIVES AND THE QUALITY OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES, AND WHAT IS CUSTOMARY AND REASONABLE IN THE HEALTH CARE OR RESEARCH INDUSTRY. WHEN A PERSON HAS, OR IS CONSIDERING INITIATING, A BUSINESS INTEREST OR RELATIONSHIP OUTSIDE OF CSH BUT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THE INTEREST CONSTITUTES A CONFLICT OF INTEREST REQUIRING DISCLOSURE UNDER THIS POLICY, THE PERSON SHOULD CONSULT WITH LOCAL CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAM (CRP) STAFF OR CSH LEGAL SERVICES GROUP (LSG) STAFF, AS APPROPRIATE. AS APPROPRIATE, A COI MANAGEMENT PLAN WILL BE DEVELOPED. WITH RESPECT TO THOSE AUDIENCES FOR WHICH THE C-CIRC HAS REVIEW RESPONSIBILITY, THE C-CIRC WILL FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT OF ANY SUCH COI MANAGEMENT PLAN IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL CRP STAFF OR CHI LSG STAFF, AS APPROPRIATE. THIS PLAN WILL INCLUDE DOCUMENTATION OF THE C-CIRC'S DETERMINATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. AS NECESSARY, REPORTS TO AN APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY OR SPONSOR WILL BE MADE ACCORDING TO THE RELEVANT APPENDICES TO THIS POLICY TO PROVIDE REQUIRED INFORMATION REGARDING HOW THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST WILL BE MANAGED, REDUCED, OR ELIMINATED. DESIGNATED CSH ENTITY STAFF ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THE COI MANAGEMENT PLAN AND FOR DOCUMENTING MONITORING ACTIVITIES. AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, A CSH ENTITY MAY REJECT A PERSON'S REQUEST TO ENTER INTO THE RELATIONSHIP IN QUESTION, OR REQUIRE THE RELATIONSHIP BE SUFFICIENTLY ALTERED TO AVOID A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE C-CIRC WILL DETERMINE WHETHER A DISCLOSED OR OTHERWISE IDENTIFIED INTEREST IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. IF THE C-CIRC DETERMINES THAT A POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST EXISTS THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS TO ADDRESS THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST, IT MAY RECOMMEND THAT THE DISCLOSING PERSON BE ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ACTIVITY OR TRANSACTION SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS AS OUTLINED IN A WRITTEN COI MANAGEMENT PLAN. ALL DETERMINATIONS OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL BE REPORTED AS REQUIRED BY LAW, REGULATIONS, AND CSH POLICY. IF A PERSON, OTHER THAN A BOARD OR BOARD COMMITTEE MEMBER OR CORPORATE OFFICER, REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A COI DISCLOSURE DOES NOT AGREE WITH A DETERMINATION MADE BY THE C-CIRC, ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE COI POLICY, STILL SEEKS AN EXEMPTION OR EXCEPTION, OR SEEKS FURTHER CLARIFICATION OF THE C-CIRC'S DECISION, THE FOLLOWING STEPS SHOULD BE FOLLOWED. WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE OF THE C-CIRC'S DECISION, THE PERSON MUST PRESENT THE MATTER TO THE PERSON'S IMMEDIATE DIRECT MANAGER OR SUPERVISOR (OR IN THE CASE OF A RESEARCHER, TO [FILL IN THE TITLE OR POSITION TO WHOM RESEARCHERS REPORT]) AND REQUEST RECONSIDERATION, SUBMITTING AT THAT TIME ANY NEW OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY SUPPORT OR RECOMMEND RECONSIDERATION. IF THE PERSON'S MANAGER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN CONSULTATION WITH THE MANAGER'S VICE PRESIDENT (OR HIGHER IF THE MANAGER IS A VICE PRESIDENT) FINDS THAT NEW INFORMATION SUPPORTING RECONSIDERATION HAS BEEN PRESENTED, THE MANAGER WILL CONTACT LOCAL OR NATIONAL CRP STAFF, AS APPROPRIATE, AND REQUEST THAT THE MATTER BE RE-PRESENTED TO THE C-CIRC. THE C-CIRC WILL BE RECONVENED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND, FOLLOWING SUCH RECONSIDERATION, ISSUE A FINAL DETERMINATION. THIS APPEALS PROCESS IS INTENDED TO BE NARROWLY APPLIED, AS PERSONS SEEKING CONFLICT OF INTEREST EXEMPTIONS OR EXCEPTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO OFFER ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION SUPPORTING AN EXEMPTION OR EXCEPTION AT THE TIME THE MATTER IS FIRST PRESENTED TO THE C-CIRC. MANAGEMENT OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF BOARD OR BOARD COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CORPORATE OFFICERS WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE APPROPRIATE BOARD, AS REFLECTED IN THE POLICY. REVIEWS AND DETERMINATIONS INVOLVING BOARD AND BOARD COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CORPORATE OFFICERS WILL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOARD, BOARD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, OR BOARD CHAIR, WITH GUIDANCE FROM THE LEGAL SERVICES GROUP (LSG). EACH TRUSTEE AND CORPORATE OFFICER MUST PROMPTLY AND FULLY REPORT TO THE BOARD CHAIR SITUATIONS THAT MAY CREATE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST WHEN HE OR SHE BECOMES AWARE OF SUCH SITUATIONS. IN ANY SITUATION WHEN A TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER IS IN DOUBT, FULL DISCLOSURE SHOULD BE MADE TO PERMIT AN IMPARTIAL AND OBJECTIVE DETERMINATION. A WRITTEN RECORD OF THE DISCLOSURE WILL BE MADE. IN ADDITION TO THE ONGOING DISCLOSURE OBLIGATION, ALL TRUSTEES AND CORPORATE OFFICERS SHALL COMPLETE A COI DISCLOSURE QUESTIONNAIRE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. A COPY OF THE COI POLICY SHALL BE AVAILABLE TO TRUSTEES AND CORPORATE OFFICERS. DEFINITIONS OF TERMS USED IN THE DISCLOSURE QUESTIONNAIRE/FORM SHALL ALSO BE INCLUDED. EACH TRUSTEE AND CORPORATE OFFICER MUST PROMPTLY COMPLETE THE COI DISCLOSURE. COI DISCLOSURES THAT INVOLVE NO DISCLOSURES OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WILL NOT REQUIRE REVIEW. DISCLOSURES OF PERCEIVED, POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ON THE COI QUESTIONNAIRE INVOLVING FINANCIAL INTERESTS WILL BE REVIEWED BY NATIONAL OR REGIONAL LSG."

IF THE CONFLICT INVOLVES THE BOARD CHAIR, THE VICE CHAIR WILL ASSUME THE CHAIR'S ROLE OUTLINED IN THE COI POLICY. BASED ON REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE BOARD CHAIR WILL MAKE AN INITIAL DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER A CONFLICT OF INTEREST EXISTS AND WHETHER, PURSUANT TO THE COI POLICY, REVIEW AND APPROVAL OR OTHER ACTION BY THE BOARD IS REQUIRED. A WRITTEN RECORD OF THE BOARD CHAIR'S DETERMINATION, INCLUDING RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WILL BE MADE. THE BOARD CHAIR SHALL THEN MAKE AN APPROPRIATE REPORT TO THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD CONCERNING SUCH REVIEW, EVALUATION AND DETERMINATION. IF A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION EXISTS BETWEEN THE BOARD CHAIR AND ANOTHER TRUSTEE AS TO WHETHER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF A GIVEN SITUATION CONSTITUTE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR WHETHER BOARD REVIEW AND APPROVAL OR OTHER ACTION IS REQUIRED WITHIN THE COI POLICY, THE MATTER SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE BOARD'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, WHICH SHALL MAKE A FINAL DETERMINATION AS TO THE MATTER PRESENTED. SUCH DETERMINATION, INCLUDING RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MINUTES AND WILL BE REPORTED TO THE BOARD.

THE BOARD MUST APPROVE THE TRANSACTION BY A MAJORITY OF THE TRUSTEES ON THE BOARD, WITHOUT COUNTING THE VOTE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS AN INTEREST IN THE TRANSACTION. IN REVIEWING SUCH TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN CSH OR CSH ENTITIES AND VENDORS OR OTHER CONTRACTORS WHO ARE, OR ARE AFFILIATED WITH, TRUSTEES OR CORPORATE OFFICERS, THE BOARD SHALL ACT NO MORE OR LESS FAVORABLY THAN IT WOULD IN REVIEWING TRANSACTIONS WITH UNRELATED THIRD PARTIES. THE TRANSACTION WILL NOT BE APPROVED UNLESS THE BOARD DETERMINES THAT THE TRANSACTION IS FAIR TO CSH OR THE CSH ENTITY. THE BOARD SHALL CAREFULLY REVIEW AND SCRUTINIZE ANY NON-TRANSACTIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (E.G., DISCLOSURE OF NONPUBLIC INFORMATION, COMPETITION WITH CSH OR A CSH ENTITY, FAILURE TO DISCLOSE A CORPORATE OPPORTUNITY, EXCESSIVE GIFTS OR ENTERTAINMENT, ETC.). BY A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE DISINTERESTED TRUSTEES, THE BOARD SHALL TAKE WHATEVER ACTION IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE WITH RESPECT TO THE TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING POSSIBLE DISCIPLINARY OR CORRECTIVE ACTION, IN ORDER TO BEST PROTECT THE INTERESTS OF CSH OR THE CSH ENTITY. THE BOARD SHOULD CONSULT WITH THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF CSH OR HIS OR HER DESIGNEE WHEN CONSIDERING DISCIPLINARY OR CORRECTIVE ACTION. WHEN ANY CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD, THE TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE, MUST DISCLOSE ALL OF THE MATERIAL FACTS TO THE BOARD. THE TRUSTEE SHALL NOT VOTE AND THE TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER SHALL NOT USE HIS OR HER PERSONAL INFLUENCE ON THE MATTER. HOWEVER, IF REQUESTED, SUCH TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER IS NOT PREVENTED FROM BRIEFLY STATING HIS OR HER POSITION IN THE MATTER, NOR FROM ANSWERING PERTINENT QUESTIONS FROM TRUSTEES, AS HIS OR HER KNOWLEDGE MAY BE OF SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE. THE TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER SHALL BE EXCUSED FROM THE MEETING DURING DISCUSSION AND VOTE ON THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST. MINUTES OF THE BOARD SHALL REFLECT THE FOLLOWING: THE INDIVIDUAL MAKING THE DISCLOSURE, THE NATURE OF THE DISCLOSURE, DISCUSSION REGARDING ANY PROPOSED TRANSACTION, THE DECISION MADE BY THE BOARD, AND THAT THE INTERESTED TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER WAS EXCUSED DURING THE DISCUSSION, AND THAT THE INTERESTED TRUSTEE ABSTAINED FROM VOTING. IF THE BOARD REASONABLY BELIEVES THAT A TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER HAS FAILED TO DISCLOSE EITHER AN ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST, OR ALL MATERIAL FACTS SURROUNDING AN ACTUAL OR POSSIBLE CONFLICT AS REQUIRED BY THE COI POLICY, THE TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER WILL BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN SUCH ALLEGED FAILURE TO DISCLOSE. AFTER HEARING THE RESPONSE OF THE TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER, THE BOARD WILL CONDUCT SUCH ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION AS MAY BE APPROPRIATE. IF THE BOARD DETERMINES THAT THE TRUSTEE OR CORPORATE OFFICER HAS IN FACT FAILED TO DISCLOSE AS REQUIRED BY THE COI POLICY, THE BOARD SHALL TAKE APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY OR CORRECTIVE ACTION.

Goodwill SOLAC is one of 165 independent Goodwills with membership in Goodwill Industries International (GII). Goodwill SOLAC's headquarters in Long Beach houses its administrative offices, training programs, processing operations, transportation fleet, LiNKS Sign Language & Interpreting Services, a retail store and its e-commerce operations (https://www.shopgoodwill.com/longbeach). In 2018, Goodwill SOLAC celebrated over 90 years of service to the 26 cities/communities, which encompass our service area. Our heritage dates back to 1902 when the Reverend Edgar J. Helms placed into action his vision of helping people transition from dependency to self-sufficiency through work and career development services. Reverend Helms' vision lives on today in the independent, community-based Goodwills located within in the United States and Canada. Goodwill also has a presence in 13 other countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Finland, South Korea and Thailand. Goodwill SOLAC's Workforce Development programs consider the quality-of-life factors for each person served, backed by the belief that all individuals should be empowered to find and keep meaningful employment and inclusion into their community. Our skills training, education, job preparation and placement programs build lives, families and communities-one job at a time. Placing individuals in productive and competitive employment fills them with the value, joy and dignity of a paycheck. We believe putting people to work not only benefits the individual, but also the community's economic vitality through taxes, spending power, real estate values, quality of life, and relief from social services and welfare systems. Goodwill SOLAC also provides follow along services for five (5) years to all students in certified training programs."
