St. Francis provides diagnostic testing, screenings and biopsies to hospitals, physicians and community clinics in the Leon, Nicaragua area.Due to the current political regime in Nicaragua, laboratories performing such services are only allowed to be paid at the contractual rate established by the goverment. The goverment-mandated payment rates for pathology services are far below the actual cost of providing such services. Due to this discrepency, pathology laboratories are unable to provide much-needed medical tests to the people of Nicaragua without additional funding. In addition, the current turnaround times for some diagnostic tests are extremely long. St. Francis provides the people of Nicaragua with the necessary tests on an expediated basis.In addition, St. Francis provides funds pathology services to other non-profit organizations (such as Doctors Without Borders) that provide free or low cost health and medical services in and around Leon, Nicaragua.","0","19668",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Without educating the whole person, children are left without the tools necessary to be a productive and well-adjusted member of society. It costs thousands of dollars each year for each individual incarcerated or receiv1ng public support. Any investment in education to encourage a young person to achieve their God-given potential is well worth the price! ASLAN has developed a successful and highly respected mentor/tutorial program in which ASLAN'S volunteer tutors work one-on-one and provide much-needed educational and emotional support for their students. The heart of this program is the relationships that are built between mentors and children. Many individuals spend quality hours with their students outside of tutoring - attending cultural events,taking the children home on weekends for church activities, sporting events etc. ASLAN incorporates a peer-mentoring program that involves a number of high school students. ASLAN offers substantial scholarship assistance to students who are regular participants in our youth classes and mentor/tutorial programs. ASLAN has provided over $50,000 in scholarship assistance to graduates of our programs.In Kind Donations and Grants Received Totaling : $64,238Time $30,838Space $33,400Goods",NA,"69252","35863","RECREATION:Each ASLAN program provides wonderful recreational and cultural enrichment activities for area youth. These field trips and activities include: bicycle adventure trips; swimming; winter alpine ski trips; whitewater rafting; hiking; summer camping; and, summer softball. As emphasized previously, Aslan seeks to teach young people basic life skills through each of these activities - how to relate as a team; how to control your emotions; how to consider the needs of others above your own needs; how to make wise decisions, even in the midst of difficult situations; recognizing that many choices you make as a young person will permanently impact your future. CYCLING PROGRAM: Aslan operates numerous major rides throughout the year for children from our programs. The goal of our cycling program is to stretch young people and encourage them to look beyond the difficulty of their home situations. Cycling for long distances over a variety of busy roads and highways requires strenuous training and strict discipline. Aslan youth learn valuable life skills such as working as a team, watching out for others, camping and other things they could learn in no better environment.In Kind Donations and Grants Received Totaling : $101,142Time $ 46,977Space $ 14,100Goods $ 40,065",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

THESE AND OTHER WSF ORIGINAL RESEARCH REPORTS ARE QUOTED DAILY IN MEDIA, ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH SETTINGS. FOLLOWING ARE BRIEF SYNOPSES OF RECENTLY COMPLETED PROJECTS:1. GO OUT AND PLAY: YOUTH SPORTS IN AMERICA A NATIONAL RESEARCH TEAM HEADED BY DR. DON SABO, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR RESEARCH ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, SPORTS, AND HEALTH, D'YOUVILLE COLLEGE, STUDIED THE SPORTS AND FITNESS PARTICIPATION OF BOYS AND GIRLS 8-18 (TO ALLOW COMPARISONS) AND THE FACTORS THAT IMPACT THEIR PARTICIPATION. VARIABLES ADDRESSED INCLUDE RACE, ETHNICITY, AGE, SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS, FAMILY SUPPORT AND ROLE MODELING, CULTURAL BARRIERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIERS IN A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE AND IN 10-20 COMMUNITIES THAT RANK LOW ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF GIRLS, OVER-SAMPLING THESE GROUPS AND OTHER RACE, ETHNIC AND ECONOMIC DEMOGRAPHICS TO INCREASE THE POWER OF THE STUDY. THE WSF HAS AN EXEMPLARY TRACK RECORD OF PERFORMING PUBLIC SERVICE RESEARCH. THIS RESEARCH REPORT IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TO MEASURE A NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF GIRLS AND BOYS AND THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS. THE STUDY WILL BE REPEATED EVERY TWO YEARS TO TRACK PROGRESS.2. EXPANDING THE BOUNDARIES OF SPORT MEDIA RESEARCH: AN EXPLORATION OF CONSUMER RESPONSES TO REPRESENTATIONS OF WOMEN'S SPORTSOVER THE PAST THREE DECADES, SPORT MEDIA SCHOLARS HAVE CONSISTENTLY UNCOVERED TWO PATTERNS OF REPRESENTATION THROUGHOUT MAINSTREAM MEDIA: 1) FEMALE ATHLETES, COMPARED TO THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS, ARE SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERREPRESENTED WITH RESPECT TO AMOUNT OF COVERAGE (FINK & KENSICKI, 2002; KANE & BUYSSE, 2005); AND 2) SPORTSWOMEN ARE ROUTINELY PRESENTED IN WAYS THAT EMPHASIZE THEIR FEMININITY AND HETEROSEXUALITY VERSUS THEIR ATHLETIC COMPETENCE (KANE, 1998; PARKER, 2002). THESE TRENDS HAVE BEEN REMARKABLY RESILIENT: THEY HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN PRINT AND BROADCAST JOURNALISM, AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ATHLETIC INVOLVEMENT (E.G., OLYMPIC, COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS) AND REGARDLESS OF TIME PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO TITLE IX. REGARDING THIS LATTER POINT, DUNCAN AND MESSNER (2005) FOUND THAT SPORTSWOMEN CONTINUE TO BE LARGELY INVISIBLE THROUGHOUT THE VAST MEDIA LANDSCAPE, WHERE THEY TYPICALLY RECEIVE ONLY 6-8% OF ALL SPORT COVERAGE. THIS IGNORES THE REALITY OF WOMEN'S OVERALL LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT IN THAT THEY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ALL SPORT PARTICIPANTS NATIONWIDE. IT ALSO IGNORES ANOTHER REALITY SPORTSWOMEN COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY HALF OF ALL THOSE INVOLVED IN INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS (ACOSTA & CARPENTER, 2006).3. TITLE IX RESEARCH SERIESTHE WOMEN'S SPORTS FOUNDATION HAS ASSEMBLED A TITLE IX RESEARCH TEAM LED BY DR. JOHN J. CHESLOCK, OF PENN STATE UNIVERSITY (FORMERLY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA) TO PRODUCE A SERIES OF THREE REPORTS ON TITLE IX WHICH WILL ESSENTIALLY ANSWER THREE RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTIONS:1. HOW HAS MALE AND FEMALE ATHLETIC PARTICIPATION CHANGED OVER TIME?2. WHAT FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THESE CHANGES IN ATHLETIC PARTICIPATION? WHILE THESE THREE QUESTIONS ARE SIMPLE, THE REPORTS WILL BE OF SUBSTANTIAL DEPTH. TO FULLY ANSWER THE RELATIVELY BROAD QUESTIONS LISTED ABOVE, ONE NEEDS TO ANSWER A VARIETY OF UNDERLYING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE ANSWERS TO EACH QUESTION CAN DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY BY THE TYPE OF INSTITUTION EXAMINED. NCAA DIVISION I-A INSTITUTIONS, NCAA DIVISION III INSTITUTIONS, AND NJCAA INSTITUTIONS ARE UNLIKELY TO ACT IN A SIMILAR FASHION. EACH OF THESE REPORTS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY INFLUENCE THE DEBATE OVER TITLE IX WITH THE WOMEN'S SPORTS FOUNDATION LEADING A MEDIA EFFORT TO DISSEMINATE THIS WORK BROADLY. 4. WOMEN IN THE 2010 OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC WINTER GAMESTHE 2010 STUDY REPLICATES THE FOUNDATION'S ""WOMEN IN THE 2006 OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC WINTER GAMES: AN ANALYSIS OF PARTICIPATION, LEADERSHIP AND MEDIA COVERAGE"" REPORT, A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY GRADING THE PARITY OF WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION AND LEADERSHIP FOR THE OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC WINTER GAMES.

Launched in March 2012, the Network is the worlds leading initiative fostering capacity building and policy development in this field. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called the Latin American Network an effective partnership for prevention. The Network provides a space for the exchange of best practices for public officials. Among its goals, the Network aims to institutionalize a culture of genocide prevention throughout Latin Americas governments, which can serve as an example to be followed in other regions worldwide. This is achieved through national programs, regional initiatives, and a curriculum on genocide and mass atrocity prevention, finalized and approved by all member states. As Technical Secretariat, the Auschwitz Institute supports all participating institutions of member states of the Network by co-organizing training seminars and by assisting in the development of a unified national policy on genocide prevention. Member countries of the Network include: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mxico, Nicaragua, Panam, Paraguay, Per, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The Latin American curriculum on genocide and mass atrocity is piloted through bi-annual Lemkin Seminars held on the site of the former German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp Auschwitz-Birkenau in Oswiecim, Poland, and at predetermined locations in Latin America. The Latin American edition of the Lemkin Seminaraddresses the regions current realities and the strengths of the regional system in dealing with 1) systematic human rights abuses of the past; 2) the rights of indigenous peoples; and 3) the rights of political groups. Seminar participants will become the instructors that are facilitating the national implementation of the curriculum in their respective countries after 2016.",NA,"277152","188934","African Programming: Regional and sub-regional programs in genocide and mass atrocity prevention.

Our programs in Africa aim to familiarize AUC officials, EAC officials, and member states with the concept of genocide, its relation to the broader category of mass atrocity, and the process by which genocide occurs. Since 2014, AIPR has organized capacity building seminars in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia to support national committees on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and all forms of discrimination in these countries and throughout the great lakes region.",NA,"14772",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
