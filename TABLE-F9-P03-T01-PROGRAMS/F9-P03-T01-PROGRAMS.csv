St. Francis provides diagnostic testing, screenings and biopsies to hospitals, physicians and community clinics in the Leon, Nicaragua area.Due to the current political regime in Nicaragua, laboratories performing such services are only allowed to be paid at the contractual rate established by the goverment. The goverment-mandated payment rates for pathology services are far below the actual cost of providing such services. Due to this discrepency, pathology laboratories are unable to provide much-needed medical tests to the people of Nicaragua without additional funding. In addition, the current turnaround times for some diagnostic tests are extremely long. St. Francis provides the people of Nicaragua with the necessary tests on an expediated basis.In addition, St. Francis provides funds pathology services to other non-profit organizations (such as Doctors Without Borders) that provide free or low cost health and medical services in and around Leon, Nicaragua.","0","19668",NA,NA,NA
